\title{Chapter 1: Matrices and Gaussian Elimination}

\section{1.1 - Introduction}
* Two ways to solve a system of equations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using elimination - Gaussian elimination is consistently used to solve large systems of equations.
    \item Using determinants
\end{itemize}
* Two ways in which elimination can break down:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the system is inconsistent, it has no solutions.
    \item If the system is dependent, it has infinitely many solutions.
\end{itemize}
